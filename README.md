# create-pypi-project

Hello, this is a project for developers who make pypi projects and setting up the files and folders is very time consuming so I created this open source package with you can create your files within seconds


How do I use it?


First of all install the package using "pip"


```shell
pip install create-pypi-project
```


Last step, just type this in your terminal:


```shell
createpypiproject --name Mygoodproject --author Haider
```


Remember "--name" and "--author" are required
